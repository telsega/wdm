"wdm is a graphical interface used to authenticate a user to the system and "
"perform the login process.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Enter your user name (userid) at the prompt and press <enter>.  The panel "
"will then present a prompt to enter your password.  Enter the password and "
"press <enter>.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The login will then be performed and your window manager started.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Start WM PopUp selection specifies the parameter to pass to Xsession to "
"start the window manager.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"NoChange will start the same window manager the user used for their last "
"session.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"failsafe is a simple xterm session and the other listed options will start "
"the indicated (installation specific) window manager.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The Options PopUp selection specifies:\n"
"\n"
"     Login - logon to the system\n"
"\n"
"     Reboot - shutdown and reboot the system\n"
"\n"
"     Halt - shutdown the system and halt\n"
"\n"
"     ExitLogin - exit the display manager\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"The installation may require a valid username and password or username=root "
"and root's password to perform Reboot, Halt or Exit.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"NOTE:  ExitLogin (or, as it is sometimes refered to: exit) is intended for "
"use primarily in wdm testing.  It will shut down the x-server but the wdm "
"must be terminated by other means.  Starting wdm as a detached process will "
"result that it will be very difficult  to terminate.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"ExitLogin performs the same operation as ctrl-r does for xdm.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"1. The StartOver button will erase the current login Information and begin "
"the login process again.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"2. See the man page for additional information on configuring this package.  "
"There are numerous options for setting the background color or pixmap, the "
"LoginPanel logo, the selection of window managers to start, and the login "
"verification for Reboot, halt and exit."
